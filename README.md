# SimpleNotes

I attempted to recreate the Notes app from Apple using only UIKit. This was a challenge
project assigned by Paul Hudson in 100 Days of Swift that I decided to add more features
and bring to the next level.

## Features I Implemented üõ†Ô∏è
- **Multiple Viewing Options** - ViewController's view depends on whether user choose 'Gallery' or 'List'
- **Secure Notes** - Lock sensitive notes with Face ID/Touch ID.

</p>

- **Organized Structure** - Categorize and sort notes by dates created/edited.
- **Saving Notes** - I used User Defaults (probably shouldn't haveüò≥) to save notes.
- **Insert Image** - Notes are now more visually appealing with the option to import photos.
- **Selection Overlays** - Added subview to CollectionView to highlight notes selected.

## Bugs I Plan To Fix üêû

- **CollectionView Section Header** - The headers overlap with cell titles which makes for annoying user experience.
- **Images Don't Save** - I suspect it has something to do with UserDefaults, or maybe I have to save photos as 'Data'.

## Features I Would Like to Implement ü§§
- **Text Formatting** - Right now, users cannot create bullit points or change font size.
- **Different Method of Saving** - I know how to use SwiftData in SwiftUI, but not sure if I can use it with UIKit.
